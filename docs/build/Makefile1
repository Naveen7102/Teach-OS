# A SIMPLE FIRST VERSION OF THE Makefile for one executable


# ------------- the target and how to make ------------

# Lines come in groups of this form:
# <TARGET> : <LIST OF FILES IT DEPENDS ON>
# <TAB>	   <the command to build TARGET>
# 
# Wierd:  Did you notice the <TAB> mentioned above????

# In our case:
# "hello_world" executable depends on
#        both "hello_world.c" and "hello_world.h" files
# "hello_world" is built using gcc
# Target 1
hello_world:  hello_world.c  hello_world.h
	gcc -o hello_world hello_world.c

# Did you find the <TAB> in the above example?

# -------------- Here is a useful target -------------
# cleanup utility - quite useful shorthand
# Target 2
clean:
	rm -f hello_world

# note in the case of target "clean" it has no dependencies which means that it will check nothing and do the command :-)
#
# Target 3
run:
	./hello_world
