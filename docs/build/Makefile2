# A slightly enhanced..
#     SIMPLE FIRST VERSION OF THE Makefile with some useful
#     additions 
#
# The next few lines are just shorthand definitions, 
#
# We want to make two executables
EXEC=hello_world printpid
CC=gcc

# ------------- the target and how to make ------------

# The first is always the default target to build
# lets use this to list all the executables to build

#Target 1
all: $(EXEC)

# executables : one by one say how to make each executable
# note that hello_world executable depends on both the
# hello_world.c and the hello_world.h so we list both files
# as dependencies.
# Target 2
hello_world:  hello_world.c  hello_world.h
	$(CC) -o hello_world hello_world.c

# Target 3
printpid: printpid.c
	$(CC) -o printpid printpid.c


# Target 4
# cleanup utility - quite useful shorthand
clean:
	rm -f $(EXEC)
