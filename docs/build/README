PURPOSE:
   This directory is intended to illustrate usage of Makefile
The aim is to do just enough to enable the student to start
using 'make' to build executables on a regular basis

MORE INFORMATION:
See 'man make' for info on the make command
See
      https://www.gnu.org/software/make/manual/html_node/Introduction.html#Introduction
    for more information on the Makefile format 

FILES:

Makefile1 
     contains a simple makefile for 
     building the hello_world program

Makefile2 extends Makefile2 and also builds printpid 

Makefile3
     Shows some additional tricks typically used to make
     Makefiles more generic .. often not needed at this level.
