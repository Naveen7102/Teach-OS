PURPOSE:
Provide suidelines to enable students to submit assignments in a uniform way to simplify build and execution:

0. Write a first version of your program and a first version of the Makefile
   Create the Makefile from the template located in:
           docs/build/Makefile?

1. Use your makefile while doing your development. (Not as an afterthought!)
   Often it is good to simply do "make" just to be sure you are 
   not breaking anything. See the compilation steps in the output to be sure.

2. Once you have done development, testing etc. Then tar things together.
   tar cvf <target-tarfile> <list of files to combine>
   tar cvf IMT2019789-Assn1.tar Makefile hello_world.c hello_world.h
   This combines into the new file     IMT2019789-Add1.tar  
   all the files listed after, i.e.  Makefile hello_world.c and hello_world.h

3. Test your tar file in a new empty directory: As an example:
   mkdir /tmp/testdir
   cp IMT2019789-Assn1.tar /tmp/testdir
   cd /tmp/testdir
   tar xvf IMT2019789-Assn1.tar     # Note the "x" in "xvf" it is for extraction
   make	
 
   It should build properly, and execute properly after that.

4. Submit the tar file  AFTER you are happy your build and execution worked 
   FROM THE TEST DIRECTORY.
