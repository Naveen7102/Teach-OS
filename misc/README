ABOUT
	Some miscellaneous files to try things out

FILES
	check-endian.c		checks the endian-ness of the CPU
				./check-endian [-]

	gtotd.c			read the comment in the program - to understand vdso

	Trivial programs to try out by disassembling, stracing, ltracing etc
	     printpid.c
	     reading.c
	     fact.c
	     x.c
	     y.c
	        - objdump -d <executable> to see the assembly 
		  dump of the final executable
		- also try gcc -S to see the assembly output
		- look inside this for syscalls
		- try again with -static compiler option

	Generate exceptions... strace it to see what happened
             divbyzero.c
             touch_bad_memory.c


Tracing programs:
	1. strace ./a.out	to see syscalls as they are made
	2. ltrace -S ./a.out  	to see both library and system calls
	   NB: gcc -no-pie  while compiling before using ltrace.
	3. gdb ./a.out
