ABOUT 
	This is about pthreads

FILES
	simple.c 	This just creates a pthread a joins
			see what happens when you do a ps
			what happens when one of them exits
	     other things to try with this file:
		pthread_self(); returns the threads on pthread_t
		pthread_equal(pthread_t,pthread_t) compares the two pthread_ts
		pthread_cancel(pthread_t) cancels 
			(causes to potentially pthread_exit()) the thread 


	prod_con.c	This is an implementation of the producer 
			consumer problem using pthreads and synchronisation

	     Also uses:
	     safe_ops.c / safe_ops.h : Simplified implementation of put/get

RUNNING
	./simple 	for the simple.c example

	./pc		for the producer-consumer example. Change 
			# threads if you wish by editing prod_con.c
